Come learn with us Python Programming Language.

## Python 

Python is an interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language with dynamic semantics. 

Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, 
as well as for use as a scripting or glue language to connect existing components together. 

Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance.
